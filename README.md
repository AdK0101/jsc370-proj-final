# Analysing How Neighbourhood Characteristics Impact AirBnB Prices

By Aditya Khan

This project looks at how different neighbourhood characteristics are associated with the price of the listing. The idea is that this can help us get a better understanding of what "immutable" factors impact the price of a listing, as well as in general, how the market works. We conduct a series of exploratory visualisations, followed by fitting a number of different models (such as linear regression models, as well as ML models like a random forest) to obtain conclusions about our question.
