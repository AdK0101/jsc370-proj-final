There are three datasets that are used in our project. Two of them, the AirBnB data and the Toronto Open Data that gives us income data, are in this data directory.

But just in case, a cloud version is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SimnKJS0D80Q20TkvkREPDgCox96V4VN/view?usp=sharing)
